* What is it based on? (Debian, Slackware, Redhat, Arch, etc)
* URL to where it can be downloaded from.
* The Supported processor architecture (x86, x86_64, arm, etc)
  
## Scenario 1: Using a Live Linux Installation

John is fixing Mario’s laptop. He needs to prepare a live USB flash drive that he can boot Linux from so that he can access some important information. The problem is that he only has a 4GB flash drive available. Which Linux distribution would you advise John to use to prepare the live USB installation? 
>**Tiny Core Linux is a 21MB graphical Linux desktop. It can boot from a USB flash drive. John needs to be sure to back up the flash drive onto the computer before loading tiny core onto the flash drive. Preparing the flash drive to boot from the USB will delete the contents of the entire flash drive.**

* What is it based on? 
  >**Independent, forked from Damn Small.**
* URL to where it can be downloaded from.
* >**http://www.tinycorelinux.net/downloads.html**
* The Supported processor architecture

## Scenario 2: Using Linux for parental control
Mario is concerned about his children using the house computer. He has an older laptop that he has not used in a while and has hired you to prepare that laptop for his children to use. Mario wants the children to use the computer mostly for educational purposes so he asks you to install educational tools in it. He is also concerned about his children using the internet so asks you if you could somehow install a web browser/search engine that has parental control or at least blocks adult content. Mario has given you $150 dollars for upgrades so that if needed you can proceed without contacting him. Which Linux distribution would install in Mario’s older laptop?
 > **I would install Puppy Linux onto the laptop. Some advantages are:**
>* **It loads into RAM, which is great for quick application loading and response to user input.**
>* **Uses 300MB.** 
>* **Easy to use, grandpa-friendly**
>* **Optimised to support older computers**


* What is it based on? 
  > **According to distrowatch.com, Puppy Linux is Independently based from Australia.**
* URL to where it can be downloaded from.: 
* >**https://puppylinux.com/index.html#download** 
* The Supported processor architecture: 
* >**i686, x86_64**

## Scenario 3: Linux + Gaming
Johanna is a gamer. She loves playing RPGs and Indie games. Johanna makes a living streaming her gaming sessions on Twitch and YouTube. She is angry because, during one of her live streams, windows 10 decided to install an update. All of Johanna’s games are available for Linux and she is good enough with computers to be able to pick up using a new operating system. Which Linux distribution would you recommend Johanna to try?
>**Pop!_OS is beginner and gamer friendly. It has an app store where Johanna could get gamer tools like Lutris, GameHub, and many others. This flavor has a cool feature called auto-tiling. It organizes multiple windows while still giving the user the ability to resize each window. This would be great for live streaming while playing games.**

## Scenario 4: Reviving an old PC
Giorgina has an old computer that came with Windows Vista. She cannot afford to buy a new computer or update her current PC. Her computer is used for online shopping, reading emails, paying her bills, and listening to music. All her music is on an external hard drive and she normally does not keep important information on her computer. Georgina is willing to pay you to make her computer faster. You have concluded that installing Linux is the simplest and most cost-efficient way to help her. However, in such an old PC, Ubuntu 20.04 will be almost as slow as Windows 10 so you need to find another distribution that is much lighter on system resources and has been designed for running on older hardware. Which distribution will you install in Georgina’s ~~dinosaur~~ PC?
