## Part 1
1. What are the advantages of open source?
   advantages of open source include:
   * Software is usually available at no cost.
   * The user can modify the code.
   * More reliable
2. What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?
    There are 4 essential freedoms that make a software open source:
    * *Freedom 0:* The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
    * *Freedom 1:* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as your wish.
    * *Freedom 2:* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.
    * *Freedom 3:* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.   
3. Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version?
   
4. Watch the following video: Why is free software important? Richard Stallman - in INT's ENLIGHTENMENT MINUTES. Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer.
    I do agree with a lot of what he said, not everything. He makes it seem like the owners of the closed source software are bad. I feel like providing software as a service is important for those of us who may not understand programming or just want our things done for us without needing to make major computing decisions.
