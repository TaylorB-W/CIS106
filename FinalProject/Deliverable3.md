# Deliverable 3: Final Deliverable
**Due date:** EOS

The students will submit the project documentation detailing all the steps they took to complete the project. Your documentation must be uploaded to Github and you will submit the URL to blackboard.

## Your document must include:
* Table of content. Divide your document in sections that make sense. I can help you with this but donâ€™t wait for the last minute. There are 30 students in this class and I am only 1.
* Screenshots properly formatted. Sloppy work = sloppy grade!
    Proper English
* Your instructions must be clear
* Proofread your documentation. Remember other people will read it and need to understand it.
* Explanations of the commands that you use. If the command is too long, break it down and explain it part by part. If the command is short, provide a straightforward explanation. Copying and pasting commands is a Joke! If you do not understand what the command does, you wasted your time and mine.
* Proper user of  markdown formatting. 
  * Bullet points
  * Block quotes
  * Code formatting
  * Links 
  * Images
* Attention to details.
* A work cited section with all the resources used in MLA format for easy reading.

I suggest you work on the documentation gradually so that I can give you pointers on what to include. You can always run your work by me before submitting
