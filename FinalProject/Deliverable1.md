# Taylor Warren Deliverable 1 |  Project Proposal
 
1. Which project will you be completing?    
    **I will be setting up a Linux virtual computer with an Ubuntu operating system for every day use.**
2. Why have you chosen this project?
    **Honestly, I did not know what to do. I am also interested to measure how much I have learned in this class as I am coming from zero knowledge on the system.**
3. What are the possible problems, roadblocks, or difficulties you anticipate during the process of completing the project?     
   **I anticipate getting in my own way as far as second guessing myself with commands and completion of the total project.** 
4. How are you planning to overcome these difficulties?     
   **I plan to give myself time to complete and edit the project. I also plan to ask questions and use the books and presentations that have been provided to find answers to things I do not know, do not remember, or is not in any notes I may have.**
5. How do you think completing this project will help you in your career?
   **I am not sure. I am still trying to figure out what my career will ultimately be. However the knowledge will surely be useful in any aspect of computer sciences.**
